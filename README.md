# radixConverter

You are required to write a C program that accepts two decimal integers, say d and r. You may assume that the first decimal integer d is nonnegative and that the second decimal integer r which represents the radix, will be one of 2, 3, 4, . . ., 15, 16. The program should convert the first decimal integer d into its representation in radix r and print the result.
